                The front-end is all about the visual side of the project, the one that users interact with. The
                back-end is what goes behind the scenes: it collects and processes data and then transfers it back to
                the client side. Roughly, the data do not go directly from user A to user Bâ€”they always pass through the
                back-end first.
